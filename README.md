The-Challenger
==============
The app based solely on the spirit of competition.

People love competition and game apps that let them beat their friends.  The problem for these competitors is they are forced to play the game they are given instead of being able to make their own.  The Challenger is an app all about challenging friends to see if they can out do you.  Example: challenge a friend to beat your best mile time.   
The app will be a game to get points that are awarded by beating the challenges set by your friends.  There will be a login feature and once logged in you can send "challenges" which you can write up yourself or use some default challenges given.  Easy, Medium, and Hard tasks can be given with a 1,2,3 point system respectively.  Honesty is required by the person doing the task and will click a "completed" or "failed" button; upon completion the score will increase against that friend.
